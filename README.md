# Algorithm Challenge #21 – Circle Area Through Circumference

## 🧮 Problem Description
This challenge focuses on calculating the **area of a circle** when the **circumference** is given.  
It applies a direct mathematical formula to derive the area without needing the radius or diameter explicitly.

---

## 🧠 Formula
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{C^2}{4 \times \pi}
\]

---

## 💡 What You’ll Learn
- How to handle user input in C++  
- Applying mathematical formulas correctly  
- Using constants (`const`) for better code readability  
- Understanding operator precedence and parentheses importance  

---

## 🧩 Example
**Input:**  
Enter the circumference of the circle: 31.4  

**Output:**  
The area of the circle is: 78.5

## 📂 File Information
- **Language:** C++  
- **File Name:** `circle_area_circumference.cpp`  
- **Challenge Number:** #21  

---

## 💬 Notes
This challenge reinforces the connection between a circle’s **circumference** and its **area**, showing how formulas can be rearranged and applied directly in programming logic.
